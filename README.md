Recognize is a facial recognition tool powered by Artificial Intelligence. It accomplishes facial recognition in 2 steps. 



To recognize a person named John Doe, it requires the following 2 steps:

- Create a directory named John and put all of John's images in it. Execute one training script, to let Recognize get familiar with John's face.
- Execute one recognition script and John would be recognized, when he approaches the webcam.

The following quick video shows the result of Recognize:

## ðŸ’¡ Features offered

- Easy training - Train Recognize for any person, by creating a directory named after that person, then loading his/her images into that directory and just executing one training script. 
- Memorization of all past training.
- Intelligence to judge new images of a person, without unnecessary retraining on images already used in past.
- Provision to erase all past memorized training and start from scratch.
- Support for jpg and png format images.
- Inbuilt converter to convert any heic format images to jpg format.
 
Available below are all the detailed steps to use this project.

## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation

### Requirement  
- Python >= 3.7 (**Required**)


### Installation

1. Clone repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akshayagarwalgithub/Recognize.git
    cd Recognize
    ```

1. **Install required packages** (depending on your local setup, feel free to use pip or pip3 whichever is suitable for your setup. Make sure you are using Python >=3.7)

    ```bash
    # Install cmake
    pip install cmake

    # Recognize uses face-recognition and internally dlib's deep learning models.
    pip install dlib

    pip install face-recognition
    
    pip install numpy
     
    pip install opencv-python
    
    pip install colorama
    ```
<br />

## :computer: Training (Step 1)
    
Recognize supports **jpg** or **png** format images for training.

**Training steps**:

1. Create a directory named :file_folder:input_images in the root path of Recognize, as follows:
```
cd Recognize
mkdir input_images
```
2. Inside :file_folder: input_images, create a subdirectory named after the person who you would like to be recognized.
Example - If we are training for John, then the folder should be named John. Along with John, if we want to train for Nina and Sam also, then create 2 more folders, one named Nina and the other named Sam. Basically create separate subdirectory (inside input_images directory) for every unique individual you would like to be recognized.

3. Put all the **jpg or png format images** of the persons inside the folder named after that person. **Please make sure the images used are solo images of the person and no group photos should be used**. In the above example, all John's images should go inside :file_folder:John. Similarly Nina and Sam's images inside :file_folder:Nina and :file_folder:Sam. Note - Different image files of the same person should have different names.

An example of such name directory hierarchy is shown below:

4. Once the images are loaded in the name folders, execute the following command to perform training (please feel free to use _python_ or _python3_ based on your Python 3 setup):
    ```
    cd Recognize
    python training_on_images.py
    ```
<br />

## :camera: :video_camera: Recognize the face (Final Step 2)
Once the training is successfully complete, execute the following command and this would activate the webcam.
```
python recognition.py
```
As this would activate the webcam, you might need to authorize access to webcam, so please do so and then execute.  
Bring the person (whose images were used for training) in front of the webcam, to get recognized :sparkles:

To close the active webcam window appearing on your screen, click anywhere on Webcam window and then press **'x'** key on your keyboard at any time.

<br />  

## :loudspeaker: Key points to remember

1. Recognize should be trained for the person you finally want to be recognized.
2. The training images should be solo image of each person. Group photos should not be used.
3. It is always preferable to use photos with visible face.
4. The better(more number of images) the training, the stronger would be the prediction.
5. The name which you choose for a person's name directory, the same name would be displayed during recognition. If the name is too long, please choose a shorter version.

<br />


## ðŸ¤– Additional available features (to be used on as-needed basis):   
     
     
### :broom: Erasing past training:
**Recognize remembers all the training it receives.** It maintains a memory of the name of every person and names of the corresponding image files used for that person. When training, it will efficiently skip retraining if it discovers the same image file name for the same person that it has previously been trained on in the past.  

If at any point you would like to train Recognize, by first erasing all the past training memory, use argument --reset_training True as follows:
```
python training_on_images.py --reset_training True 
```
  
   
   
### :iphone: Converting heic format files to jpg format: 

**Note** - _Skip this part entirely, if you don't have any image in **.heic format**._   

If you realize that some of your training images are in heic format (very common for iphone users), you must first convert them to jpg or png. This is because Recognize only accept jpg or png file formats.   
You can choose to convert heic files yourself or use Recognize's built in converter. **To use Recognize's built in converter you need to first have imagemagick installed for your Operating System.**

[imagemagick installation](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
    
Once imagemagick is installed successfully, load all the heic image files in respective name directories and execute:
```
python heic_to_jpg_converter.py
```
heic_to_jpg_converter scans all the name directories inside input_images directory and automatically converts every heic file to jpg. **It would do all the hard work of searching as well as converting.**
